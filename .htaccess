# Htaccess is a configuration file for the Apache web server. and the mod_rewrite directive tells to Apache that every request will end up to the index.php located in the folder named public.
# It means that if you browse https://pokedex-mvc-php/page1, https://pokedex-mvc-php/page2 or https://pokedex-mvc-php/page3, all of them will end up in the index.php under public, that is the entry point of your PHP MVC framework
# This is a big advantage because you can now handle your request in one place, understand what resource is requested and provide the right response.
